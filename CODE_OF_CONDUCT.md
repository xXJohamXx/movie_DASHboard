## Code of Conduct

A respectful space for contributors and participants is what the code of conduct seeks to establish by fostering an open and inclusive environment. We commit to being approachable, considerate, and respectful to everyone, regardless of their age, size, ability, ethnicity, degree of experience, country of origin, outward appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

In all forms of collaborative interaction, we strive to provide standard behaviors.

## SCOPE 

The scope of this code of conduct applies both within a project and in public spaces where the members represent the community. The virtual space includes communicating using an official email address or official social media channels. Additionally, this applies to the public and private representation of the community.

- being considerate of other people's time and effort.
- Using an inclusive and welcoming language
- Being respectful of others' experiences and viewpoints 
- Being open to different ideas and critique
- Having empathy towards other members
- Prioritizing what is best for the community
- Timely conveying the necessary information to members
 

The unacceptable behaviors typically include:

- Using derogatory language, trolling, and abusing personal and political choices

- Insults, putdowns, or jokes based on stereotypes
- Sharing other private information without permission
- Any unwanted or sexual advances
- Harassment in any form, including intentional intimidation, stalking, or following
- Creating additional online accounts to harass another person

Members conveyed to stop any behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align to this Code of Conduct and have the right to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for their inappropriate behavior.

Project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Failure to do so can lead to permanent removal from the project team.
